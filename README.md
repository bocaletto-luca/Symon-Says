## Overview
Simon Says is a classic color sequence memory game where each new level adds a random color cue (green, red, yellow, and blue) to the sequence. The game plays the sequence with smooth animations and sounds, and then waits for the player to repeat it accurately. Mistakes end the game, and the current level is shown to help track your progress.

## Features
- **Dynamic Difficulty:**  
  The flash duration and pause between cues decrease as the level increases, upping the challenge.
  
- **Responsive Fixed-Size Quadrants:**  
  The four colored quadrants maintain a consistent and square size on desktops, tablets, and smartphones using a fixed width and `aspect-ratio`. During flashes, their borders also highlight for better visibility.
  
- **Modern Design & Dark Theme:**  
  All visuals are designed with a sleek dark appearance to enhance the gaming experience.
  
- **Real-Time Feedback:**  
  Sound effects and animations provide immediate feedback on both the sequence and user inputs.

- **Clean and Single‑Page Implementation:**  
  Everything is contained within one HTML file for simplicity and fast loading.
